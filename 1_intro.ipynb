    "## **1. What is Statistics?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Statistics** is the science of **collecting, analyzing, interpreting, presenting, and organizing data**. It helps us make decisions under uncertainty by summarizing large volumes of data in meaningful ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Example:** A company wants to understand customer satisfaction. It collects survey responses and uses statistical methods to summarize, analyze, and interpret the feedback.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Two main branches of statistics:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizes and describes the features of a dataset.\n",
    "2. **Inferential Statistics:** Makes predictions or inferences about a population based on a sample.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Types of Data**\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding the type of data is crucial for choosing the right statistical method.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Qualitative (Categorical) Data:** Describes attributes or categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Nominal:** Categories with no order.\n",
    "     *Example:* Eye color (blue, brown, green)\n",
    "   * **Ordinal:** Categories with a meaningful order but not numeric differences.\n",
    "     *Example:* Ratings (poor, average, good, excellent)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Quantitative (Numerical) Data:** Numeric values.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Discrete:** Countable values.\n",
    "     *Example:* Number of students in a class\n",
    "   * **Continuous:** Any value within a range.\n",
    "     *Example:* Height, weight, temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## **3. Descriptive Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "Descriptive statistics help us **summarize and describe data**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Measures of Central Tendency**\n",
    "\n",
    "These tell us where the “center” of data lies.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Mean (Average):** Sum of all observations divided by the number of observations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   $[\n",
    "   \\text{Mean} = \\frac{\\sum x_i}{n}\n",
    "   ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "   *Example:* Scores = [80, 90, 70], Mean = (80+90+70)/3 = 80\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Median:** Middle value when data is ordered. Useful for skewed data.\n",
    "   *Example:* Scores = [70, 80, 90], Median = 80\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Mode:** Most frequent value. Useful for categorical data.\n",
    "   *Example:* Colors = [Red, Blue, Blue, Green], Mode = Blue\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Measures of Dispersion**\n",
    "\n",
    "These tell us how spread out the data is.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Range:** Difference between the largest and smallest values.\n",
    "2. **Variance ((σ^2))**: Average squared deviation from the mean.\n",
    "3. **Standard Deviation ((σ))**: Square root of variance. Gives dispersion in original units.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   $[\n",
    "   \\sigma = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\sum (x_i - \\bar{x})^2}{n}}\n",
    "   ]$\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example:* If exam scores vary a lot among students, standard deviation will be high.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Other Descriptive Measures**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Percentiles & Quartiles:** Divide data into parts (e.g., median is 50th percentile).\n",
    "* **Skewness:** Measures asymmetry of data.\n",
    "* **Kurtosis:** Measures how “peaked” the data distribution is.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Probability and Probability Distributions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Statistics is rooted in **probability**, which quantifies uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Probability:** Likelihood of an event occurring, $(0 \\leq P \\leq 1)$.\n",
    "  *Example:* Probability of rolling a 3 on a die = 1/6.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Common Probability Distributions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Discrete Distributions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Binomial:** Success/failure experiments.\n",
    "   * **Poisson:** Rare events in fixed intervals.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Continuous Distributions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Normal Distribution (Bell curve):** Symmetrical; mean = median = mode.\n",
    "   * **Uniform, Exponential, etc.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use in statistics:** Understanding distributions allows us to calculate probabilities and apply inferential methods.\n",

    "## **5. Inferential Statistics**\n",
    "\n",
    "While descriptive statistics summarizes data, **inferential statistics** lets us **make decisions or predictions**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Sampling**\n",
    "\n",
    "We often study a **sample** instead of the entire population.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Population:** Entire group we want to study.\n",
    "* **Sample:** Subset of the population.\n",
    "* **Sampling Methods:** Simple random, stratified, cluster, systematic.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Estimation**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Point Estimate:** Single value (e.g., sample mean).\n",
    "* **Interval Estimate (Confidence Interval):** Range of values likely to contain population parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. Hypothesis Testing**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Null Hypothesis ((H_0))**: No effect or difference.\n",
    "* **Alternative Hypothesis ((H_1))**: There is an effect or difference.\n",
    "* **Steps:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. Formulate hypotheses\n",
    "  2. Choose significance level ((α), often 0.05)\n",
    "  3. Compute test statistic (e.g., t-test, z-test)\n",
    "  4. Make decision: reject or fail to reject (H_0)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** Testing if a new teaching method improves scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **D. Correlation & Regression**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Correlation:** Measures strength of linear relationship between two variables ((-1) to (1)).\n",
    "* **Regression:** Predicts one variable from another using a linear model.\n",
    "  *Example:* Predict sales based on advertising spend.\n",
